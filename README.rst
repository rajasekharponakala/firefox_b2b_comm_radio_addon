Vision :
~~~~~~~~

To design a system for ease of Individual Internet access and
circumventing Individual censorship while working with open communities.

Statement:
~~~~~~~~~~

Establishing the Radio communication between two or more systems by
establishing communication between two or more open browsers within the
Radio frequency range with the helpful combination of `GNU
radio <https://gnuradio.org>`__-Software Defined Radio(SDR software + RF
Hardware) with Firefox web browser addon.

**Problem:** 1. When user is refused for Internet
connection(Wireless/Wired). 2. When Specific user is censored to access
Web.

**The Objectives and Implementations of This project includes:** 1.
Establishing the Radio communication between two or more systems by
establishing communication between two or more open browsers within the
Radiofrequency range. 2. This is by integrating (Firefox) browser with
GNU radio -and SDR Hardware. Taking the advantage of developing and
implementing Firefox addon(s). 3. Taking the advantage of complete Open
policy implementation.

**Advantages:**

A System/Device which is censored(refused internet connection) to access
Web, can Privately access Web:

1. This helps in communicating with nearby systems(having Internet
   access) within the radio frequency range when your(or someones)
   Internet service Provider refused to provide user based internet
   and/or when there is individual user defined Censorship for accesing
   Web.
2. Need no direct internet access(or WiFi network) for two or more
   system communication within the range.
3. Increases the anonymity and privacy of the user by Hiding the true
   (IP) address of Orginating system.
4. Avoiding the internal censorship while connecting to other systems
   for accessing the Internet.
